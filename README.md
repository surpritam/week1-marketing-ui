# Week1 Challenge
This repository contains the week1 challenge of making the marketing demo site more accessible and optimized for search engines

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criterias
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Updates
Added title of the website under head - title
Replaced existing HTML elements with semantic elements like header, section, article, aside, and footer
Instead of using background-image in CSS, replaced it with img tag with src and alt attribute
Added alt attribute to all img tags
Consolidated the CSS elements to reduce duplication
Used Github pages to host the website : https://surpritam.github.io/week1-marketing-ui/
